    <h1 id="top">Hi there. I'm Lourdes (they/she). I was KMHS Valedictorian in 2018 and just graduated from Yale this May. I'm building a community of KMHS Alumni who feel hurt by the school in any way so that we can come together to mitigate and prevent future pain, and show current LGBTQ+ and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) students that they are not alone. </h1>
    <h2>Here's what you can expect from the community:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Opportunity to present your grievances to faculty in a meeting(s) liased by Lourdes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Information on town hall calls where we can heal together and pool our knowledge and resources to bring positive change to the lives of catholic school students everywhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        New pals you went to school with but never talked to... until now xo
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>For now, add your email for updates from me. </h2>
